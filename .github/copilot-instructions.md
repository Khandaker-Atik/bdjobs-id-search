This project is a Vite + React + TypeScript web app for animated BDJobs custom search. Use Framer Motion for UI animations. The app should allow users to input a BDJobs job ID, fetch and display job details from the BDJobs website, include animated transitions, a button to open the job in a new tab, and a footer crediting 'khandaker atik, email: Khandakeratik43@gmail'.
